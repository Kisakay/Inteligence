content:France's Assemblée Nationale on Tuesday, March 12 approved the government's Ukraine strategy, including a bilateral security agreement signed by Presidents Emmanuel Macron and Volodymyr Zelensky last month. The Sénat was set to hold similar debates on Wednesday."Ukraine is watching us, waiting for the confirmation and signal of our unity behind them," French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal told the chamber ahead of the vote. He added that "we are at a tipping point" in the conflict and that a Russian victory had "real, tangible dangers" for "everyday life for the French people."With the symbolic vote, Macron forced political parties to take a public stance on the conflict as Russia's invasion of Ukraine stretches into its third year. The far-right Rassemblement National (RN), which polls say is ahead of Macron's coalition by a wide margin in the June European elections, abstained, while the radical-left La France Insoumise party voted against.Targeting the RN, Attal said ahead of the vote that "to abstain is to flee before your responsibility to history and to betray what is dearest to us." He signed off his opening speech with the Ukrainian battle cry of "Slava Ukraini."Speaking for the RN, party figurehead Marine Le Pen attacked Macron's "warlike announcements," in reference to his not ruling out the sending of Western troops to Ukraine. She also condemned European sanctions on Russian exports, "some (of which) have considerably weakened our economies", and rejected the possibility of Ukraine becoming a member of NATO and the EU.The vote was designed so that "either we're in favor of Macron, or we're accused of being pro- (Russian President Vladimir) Putin," Le Pen charged, accusing the government of "hijacking, exploiting and instrumentalizing a major international crisis for a short-term electoral agenda."LFI said it would vote "against war" and the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO and the European Union in the future.Macron is set to speak about the war in a prime-time TV broadcast on Thursday evening.
